# WalletConnect Configuration Fix

## Issues Identified

1. **CSP Blocking** - Content Security Policy was blocking Web3Modal/Reown APIs
2. **Missing Asset** - grid.svg background pattern was not found
3. **Domain Allowlist** - seipay.vercel.app not configured in WalletConnect Cloud

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Content Security Policy Updated
The CSP in `next.config.ts` has been updated to include:
- `https://api.web3modal.org` - Web3Modal configuration API
- `https://*.reown.com` and `wss://*.reown.com` - Reown services
- `https://pulse.walletconnect.org` - WalletConnect telemetry

### 2. Grid SVG Created
A subtle grid pattern SVG has been added to `/public/grid.svg` for the background effect.

### 3. WalletConnect Cloud Configuration Required

**Action needed by the project owner:**

1. Visit https://cloud.reown.com or https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Sign in with the account that owns project ID: `719d0ccc89683c6417332eec3961fc8d`
3. Navigate to the project settings
4. Add the following domains to the allowlist:
   - `seipay.vercel.app`
   - `localhost:3000` (for development)
   - Any other domains where the app will be hosted

## Alternative Solution

If WalletConnect Cloud access is not available, create a new project:

1. Visit https://cloud.walletconnect.com
2. Create a new project
3. Copy the new Project ID
4. Update `.env.local`:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_new_project_id
   ```
5. Add your domains to the allowlist

## Verification

After deploying these changes:

1. The CSP errors should be resolved
2. The grid background should display correctly
3. WalletConnect will work once the domain is allowlisted

## Non-Critical Warnings

The following warnings may still appear but do not affect functionality:
- "Failed to fetch remote project configuration" - This occurs when using default values
- "eth getParams" - Normal WalletConnect initialization message

These can be safely ignored as the wallet connection will still function properly.
