# AI Payment Assistant Transaction Fix

## Issue
The AI Payment Assistant was displaying transaction details but not actually triggering wallet signing when the "Execute Transaction" button was clicked.

## Root Cause
The PaymentAgent component was missing:
1. Wagmi hooks for transaction execution
2. onClick handler for the Execute Transaction button
3. Wallet connection integration

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Added Wagmi Imports
```typescript
import { useSendTransaction, useWaitForTransactionReceipt, useAccount } from 'wagmi';
import { parseEther } from 'viem';
import { DEFAULT_NETWORK } from '@/lib/sei/config';
```

### 2. Integrated Wallet Hooks
```typescript
const { isConnected } = useAccount();
const { sendTransaction, data: hash, isPending: isSending } = useSendTransaction();
const { isLoading: isConfirming, isSuccess: isConfirmed } = useWaitForTransactionReceipt({ hash });
```

### 3. Created executeTransaction Function
The function:
- Validates wallet connection
- Checks transaction parameters
- Calls sendTransaction with proper formatting
- Handles success/error states with toast notifications
- Updates chat messages with transaction status

### 4. Connected Button to Transaction Execution
Updated the Execute Transaction button to:
- Call executeTransaction with transaction data
- Show loading state during processing
- Disable during transaction confirmation
- Display spinner while processing

### 5. Added Transaction Monitoring
Added useEffect to monitor transaction confirmation and display success message with explorer link.

## Testing Instructions

1. Connect wallet to the dashboard
2. Open AI Payment Assistant tab
3. Type a payment command like "Send 0.001 SEI to 0x..."
4. Click "Execute Transaction" button
5. Wallet should prompt for signature
6. Transaction should process and confirm

## Security Considerations
- Wallet must be connected before executing transactions
- All transactions require user confirmation via wallet
- Transaction details are displayed before execution
- Explorer links provided for verification

## Status
âœ… Fixed and tested - Build successful
